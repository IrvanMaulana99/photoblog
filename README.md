# SUPERSYMMETRY
### Welcome! 👋🏼
*<a target="_blank" href="http://supersymmetry.design">Supersymmetry</a>* is a photo blog built on Vue/Nuxt showcasing architecture, interior design and structural engineering – basically spaces.
Feel free to dig around and check out the inner workings of the site. All images are credited to their respective owners.

### Purpose ‼️
Design and code a self-initiated photoblog, web app detailing architecture, interior design and structural engineering that is easy to update and maintain.

Supersymmetry is more of a brief repository for referencing and linking to more information on particular spaces; it is not a detail-centric knowledge base.
